dawson is a [serverless](https://auth0.com/blog/what-is-serverless/) web framework for Node.js on AWS ([CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/), [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/), [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/apigateway/), [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)).  
You can use `dawson` to build and deploy backend code and infrastructure for single-page apps + API, pure APIs or server-rendered pages.

```js
// api.js
export function greet (event) {
    const name = event.params.path.name
    return `Hello ${name}, you look awesome!`
}
greet.api = {
    path: 'greet/{name}'
}
```
```bash
$ npm install -g dawson
$ dawson deploy
```

## About
dawson lets you to deploy your Node.js apps on Amazon Web Services. It requires **no boilerplate**: no `init` command, no configuration files. Just write your functions and deploy!

You can write your functions in ES2016, ES2017, using async-await or using experimental features, like you whish. Just include a `.babelrc` and dawson will **compile** your code with [babel](https://babeljs.io) before deploying it. Your Lambda functions can be **`async`** and return **Promises**. There's also **built-in authorization support** via [API Gateway Custom Authorizers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/use-custom-authorizer.html).

Each function has its **own IAM Role**, so you can define [fine-graned IAM Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege).  
dawson offers first-class support for **Single Page Applications**: a **CloudFront** Distribution will be deployed in front of your app, correctly mapping assets and the API origin, so you don't have to worry about CORS. An [AWS WAF](https://aws.amazon.com/waf/) WebACL can also be attached to CloudFront.

dawson **does not bundle** your app with webpack, browserify or rollup, so you'll never have to deal [with](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/issues/603) [weird](https://github.com/substack/brfs) [things](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32253362/how-do-i-build-a-single-js-file-for-aws-lambda-nodejs-runtime). Your app's `devDependencies` are stripped out while deploying, keeping the bundle ZIP small.

dawson uses **pure CloudFormation templates**, following the [infrastructure-as-code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_Code) principle; it requires **no local or remote state files** which may go out-of-sync or mistakenly be deleted. You can **customize your app's template** in every part, e.g.: you can add CloudFormation Resources, modify Properties of Resources created by dawson etc. As a free benefit, you get out-of-the-box support for **multiple stages and regions**.

Finally, dawson will automatically **support HTTPS** for custom domains thanks to [AWS ACM](https://aws.amazon.com/acm/). Also, if you use [Route53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) your **DNS Zone** can be automatically updated.

#### CLI
Using the dawson command you can **deploy** the infrastructure, **inspect logs** (in real time, like `tail -f`) and spin up a **development server** which will simulate CloudFront and API Gateway, so your development environment will be almost identical to the production one.

```bash
$ dawson deploy # deploy your app
$ dawson log -f functionName --follow # get function logs
$ dawson describe # list CloudFormation outputs
$ dawson dev # start a development server
```

## Architecture

*(additionally for each region you'll deploy to, `dawson` uses a support stack with an S3 Bucket to store Lambda ZIP bundles and CloudFormation templates)*
